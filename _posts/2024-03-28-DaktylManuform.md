## 2025-04-24
I have assembled the keyboard and flashed the firmware. on the right side i got the diodes around the wrong way to had to account for that in the firmware.
Next time I build a keyboard I think ill get some bare copper hookup wire, presison side cutters, and locking precision  pliers.
Still need to get bases and hotglue the plugs inot place.

KiwiFil on an Ender 3 V2 Neo

right hand print came out well.

Print for the lefthand was not so great.
