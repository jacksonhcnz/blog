I want to build a game console that you insert a game card into and it will launch that game.
It should only allow for the game of the game card to be played. 
It should not allow anyhting else to be played or other actions to take place
There should be way to get to termanal

I think this could be done with a kiosk app that reads a barcode to launch a game.
